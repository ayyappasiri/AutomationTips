## Benifites of distributed system
- Scale horizontally
- Modular growth
- Fault tolerance
- Low Latency
- Cost effective

# N-tier architecture
- Each tier has specific responsibility
- Physically separated machines
- Improves scalability but adds latency

## Close layer
- A layer can call only the next layer immediately down.

## Open layer
- A layer can call any layer down below it.
